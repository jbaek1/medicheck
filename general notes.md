8. Early Detection of Cognitive Decline via Speech Patterns
	•	Unexplored Angle: Current Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s detection models rely on clinical observations but not daily speech changes.
	•	Potential Project: Train an NLP model that analyzes long-term conversational changes (e.g., pauses, vocabulary loss, grammatical shifts) for early cognitive decline detection.
	•	Use Case: Enable proactive intervention for neurodegenerative diseases by monitoring patient speech in telehealth sessions.
