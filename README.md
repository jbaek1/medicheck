Below is a sample README template you could use for your iOS medication-checking app. Customize each section as needed, especially around how to set up your APIs and any relevant disclaimers.

Medilocate iOS App

Medilocate is an iOS application that helps users identify over-the-counter (OTC) medications, check for drug interactions with their current prescriptions or health conditions, and set reminders for safe medication usage. It uses OCR to capture text from medication packaging, GPT-4 to identify the product and suggest alternatives, and the RxNorm API to check for potential interactions.

Features
	•	User Enrollment
	•	Collects user’s age, gender, pregnancy status, and list of currently used medications.
	•	Medication Identification
	•	Captures medication packaging via the device camera.
	•	Uses Apple’s Vision (OCR) to recognize text, then GPT-4 to identify the product and active ingredients.
	•	Drug Interaction Checks
	•	Integrates with RxNorm to map ingredients to RxCUIs and checks for potential interactions with the user’s existing medications.
	•	Alternative Suggestions
	•	GPT-4 suggests similar OTC products if the initial medication is unsafe.
	•	Notifications
	•	Local notifications remind users to take their chosen medication at specified intervals.
	•	Data Persistence
	•	Stores user profile and medication data locally (Core Data or Realm) for quick access.

Tech Stack
	•	Language & Framework: Swift, SwiftUI
	•	OCR: Vision Framework (iOS)
	•	GPT-4 Integration: OpenAI API
	•	Drug Interaction: RxNorm / RxNav APIs
	•	Local Notifications: iOS UserNotifications framework
	•	Data Persistence: Core Data (or Realm, depending on preference)

(Adjust above to reflect your exact choices.)

Architecture Overview

The app follows a simplified MVVM structure to separate business logic from UI layers:
	1.	Views (SwiftUI)
	•	OnboardingView, ScanView, ResultsView, MedicationInfoView, etc.
	2.	ViewModels
	•	Manage state and logic for each view, orchestrating network calls, local data reads/writes, and transformations for UI.
	3.	Services
	•	OCRService: Wrapper around Vision framework.
	•	GPTService: Handles calls to GPT-4 with custom prompt engineering.
	•	RxNormService: Manages mapping product/ingredient data to RxCUIs and checking interactions.
	4.	Data Layer
	•	UserProfile and Medication models stored in Core Data (or another local database solution).
	5.	Networking Layer
	•	NetworkManager to handle requests, authentication, and parsing for GPT and RxNorm endpoints.

Prerequisites
	1.	Xcode (14+ recommended)
	2.	iOS Deployment Target: iOS 15 or later (adjust based on your code)
	3.	API Keys
	•	OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4)
	•	RxNorm doesn’t strictly require a key but ensure you have the correct endpoint references.
	4.	Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods (for any 3rd party dependencies if needed).

Setup & Installation
	1.	Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Medilocate.git
cd Medilocate


	2.	Open in Xcode
	•	Double-click Medilocate.xcodeproj (or open Medilocate.xcworkspace if using CocoaPods).
	3.	Configure API Keys
	•	Create a Secrets.plist or .xcconfig file (or use environment variables) containing your OpenAI API key.
	•	Example Secrets.plist:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
     "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>OpenAIAPIKey</key>
    <string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
</dict>
</plist>


	•	Make sure to ignore this file in .gitignore to avoid exposing sensitive data.

	4.	Dependencies
	•	If using Swift Package Manager, open Xcode → File → Add Packages → Add any packages for OCR or additional libraries as needed.
	5.	Build & Run
	•	Select your Simulator or iOS device.
	•	Click the Run button in Xcode.

Usage
	1.	Onboarding:
	•	Upon first launch, the user inputs their age, gender, pregnancy status, and current medications.
	2.	Scanning a Medication:
	•	Tap Scan → the camera view appears → capture or select a medication package image → OCR processes the text → GPT-4 identifies the product and its ingredients.
	3.	Interaction Checks:
	•	The app uses RxNorm to map those ingredients to RxCUIs and checks for interactions with the user’s existing meds.
	•	Displays a “Safe” or “Not Safe” result.
	4.	Alternatives:
	•	If unsafe, GPT-4 provides suggestions. The user can select each suggestion to re-run interaction checks until finding a suitable product.
	5.	Reminders:
	•	Once a medication is confirmed safe, the user can view dosage info and set local notifications for reminders.

Roadmap
	•	Short-Term
	•	Improve OCR accuracy and prompt engineering for better GPT parsing.
	•	Add manual input fallback for medication searches.
	•	Mid-Term
	•	Enhance error handling (e.g., no internet, partial text).
	•	Refine UI/UX for scanning instructions and alternative suggestions.
	•	Long-Term
	•	Integration with wearable or health apps for tracking usage.
	•	Expand to more robust drug databases or multi-regional support.
	•	Potential AI fine-tuning for more consistent text-to-ingredient mapping.
